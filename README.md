# Fakemons project

### Overview
This is a web app made to design, spec out and share fakemons. It runs mostly offline except for fetching libraries.
#### Note: Due to it being my first ever web project, it is unoptimized and the code might be a bit wet and spaghetti.

### Features
- Customizable...
  - Dex number
  - Typing
  - Name
  - Sprite
  - Abilities
  - Stats
  - Moves (Coming soon)
- Pokemenu
  - Pokemon up to Gen 9 (including most formes)
  - Search filters
  - Fakemons box (WIP)
- Sidebar
  - Theme toggle

### Confirmed future updates
- Save fakemon locally support
- Import/Export support

### Potential future updates
- Movepool support
- Forums (highly unlikely unless this site blows up or something lol)

### Credits
- Data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

### Final notes
- Reminder that this is my first ever web development project and there's a lot to be fixed and reorganized.
